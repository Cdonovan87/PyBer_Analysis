# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of Analysis
For this challenege I was tasked with taking ride share data from different cities and analysing the differences between the diffferent city types. I was tasked with mergeing two dataframes and then grouping them by the city type to help show the differences in data between each type. I was tasked to then use this data to determine possible recomendations for the companies CEO.
## Results
Based on the final data found in the summary dataframe and the line chart created one can easily see the main differences between the three city types. As expected the number of total rides, drivers, and fares was topped by the Urban city type followed by Suburband then rural. However once we get into the average fares things get interesting. For average fare per ride and per driver the list of who had the higher number is flipped on its head with rural having the highest averages and urban having the smallest averages.Also Urban has the higher total fare compared to the other city types from January 1st, 2019 through April 28th, 2019, as can be seen in the below multiple line chart.

## Summary
After analysing the data I have come up with three potential reccomendations for the CEO of PyBer. My first reccomendation for the CEO would be to try and increase the average fare for rides in Urban cities. To do this they could either focus efforts on increasing the number of total rides and total drivers they get through strong marketing campaigns or they could increase the fare of riding one of the bikes in order to capitalise on the number of people that ride. Another reccomendation would be to focus on and capitalize on the somewhat untapped rural cities. As stated, the rural cities had the highest average fares but the lowest total fares so the ceo could focus on trying to increase the number of people who ride or the number of times a person rides their bikes in order to capitalise on the high averages that the rural city brings.Finally, my last potential reccomendation that the CEO could use is to try and capitalize on the spike of total fares for each city. As seen in the chart above it seems thats the total number of Fares spiked around the beginning of March for each city type. This could be a great time for the CEO and his company to ramp up efforts to try and get more people to use their service.
